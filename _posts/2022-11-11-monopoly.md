Monopoly is a simulation of the gameplay visualized in abstract form. 

As such, the simulation is also an image generator, each frame describing an archtypical scenario from the property market.

## Data and rules

Agents indicated by circles moving around on a "board" - a circle formation of pale circles each representing fields of various types. Agent and field sizes tied to their value. Owned fields outlined with the color of the owner. An overall agent strategy determines the will of agents to buy fields and buildings.

After some time, one agent will win a monopoly and inevitably this agent will drain the rest, turning them into tiny dots before they disappear. 



## Equilibrium

When no one manages to get a monopoly, the initial equality between agents is maintained eternally. Or so it would seem. Neither wealth or powerty exists, and nothing can distrupt the cirle of money changing hands.
