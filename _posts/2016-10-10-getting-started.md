<p>70 years ago researcher, artist and healer Emma Kunz(1892–1963), left behind an amazing body of work,
            consisting of 400 drawings which she made using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiesthesia" target="blank">radiesthesia</a>. 
            Standing in her studio in front of a black sheet of graph paper, she would ask a question to the universe or cosmos, and her pendulum would catch the 'response' in the form of energetic forces in the room.  She would then document the pendulum’s movements with crayon on the paper, conveying mathematical and spiritual laws of life. She would work non-stop untill the drawing was done, often through the night.</p>

<p>For Kunz, art was a means not an end. She used the drawings as tools of energy in her work as a healer.
            The drawings are untitled, undated and undescribed, so when we look at one of her drawings today, all we know is that for her, they each represent a divine answer from the universe or spirit. 
            Neither a literate nor a symbolic, but rather an energetic answer. </p>

<p> We will never know what she learned from these drawings. We can only give them our attention and see what shows up within ourselves.</p>

                What did she ask? 
                What where the responses?        
            </cite>




## Process and output of the study
<cite>It was never about the finished reproduction,
                  but rather about establishing and deepening 
                  some kind of connection with the drawing. </cite> 



   <p>Drawn by Emma Kunz's suggestion that her drawings would only be understood in the 21st century, I decided to study, rather than merely appreciate the drawings.</p>
                    
   <p> As a creative programmer, looking at one of her drawings for the first time triggered the operations of a computational thinker. Re-creating the drawing in code - as the contemporary tool of thinking it is - seemed like a natural way to proceed with my study of the details wihtin in.  
                    </p>


<p>
                    A drawing will initially feel secretive, even deceiving.  
                    My attempt to reviel or unlock the drawing, forces my mind's orchestration of logical analysis, intuition and subconsciousness. The act demands not only thought, but deep contemplation, which gives me access to the energy of the drawing. 
                    This is the untangible outcome of my study: knowledge.</p>
              
## This study has a two-fold output: 
   <li>
                        <strong>Animations</strong> : one line at a time, the animation mirrors the movements of the pendulum. 
                           This dimension of movement sheds light on the process with which the drawings were made, and further expands the spectator’s perception and understanding of them. 
                            </li>
                            
   <li>
                                <strong>Stills of errors</strong> :
      As I work errors occur, yielding compositions, that are simultaneously surprising, beautiful and telling in their departure from the divine response. 
      I consider these as complementary output and works in their own right.
                            </li>
